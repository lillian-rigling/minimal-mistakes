*a brief(ish) saga of our early days*

## Summer 2014: Before

In the summer of 2014, Lillian and Christopher were both fresh university graduates of the University of Toronto. Armed with degrees in the humanities (his in Classics, hers in English) they both questioned their preparation for the so-called "real world." Having spent the last 365 busy nights intermittently hunched over a keyboard or soaking up the last boozey drops of their care-free young lives, they had each somehow made time to apply for graduate programs. 

Christopher felt a strong pull towards Archives and Records Management. He enjoyed his time working in the Trinity College Archives, and, as a self-proclaimed Classicist, found comfort in the presence of old things (and in the octogenarians who needed to be reuinited with the aforementioned objects). Lillian, on the other hand, was less self-assured. She threw her hat in the ring for many programs, including a degree in Library and Information Science. She enjoyed shelving books in the large, turkey-shaped University library, as it afforded her much time to listen to audiobook and to glare disapprovingly at loud or unruly students. When she received her acceptance letter she shrugged. "Sure," she thought, "I could be a librarian."

This is how they both ended up in the same lecture hall on a Saturday morning, attending a non-mandatory but highly suggested orientation session at the University of Toronto Faculty of Information.
